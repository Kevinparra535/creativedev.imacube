# Creative Tech Manifesto - Kevin Parra (KevCoder)

I am here to transform wild ideas into tangible experiences.

To build things that are remembered, that spark curiosity, and that are fun to explore, not just to use.

Technology is an instrument: the brush.

Stories and emotions are the canvas.

Creating is experimenting, and the web is my laboratory.

I do not just code: I think like a designer.

I like to create software that conveys sensation.

A failed prototype is better than an idea never built.

Animations must say something. If they do not, we failed.

Creativity and order can coexist to materialize ideas.

Sometimes the mission is simple: **pervert the web**.

Break patterns. Hack what is expected. Surprise.

The best way to learn is by doing: build, break, delete, try again.

Everything is part of the process.

Technology is the means, never the end.

Code is also art.

Bugs are teachers.

Curiosity is the spark.

I build immersive experiences.

If the user feels something… anything… we already won.

Creating surprise with purpose is the foundation of my work.

I collaborate with designers, artists, and developers, because ideas grow when they are shared.

The best projects are built in teams, without fear of exploring the unknown.

I am a Creative Technologist. My job is to turn imagination into interactive reality.
